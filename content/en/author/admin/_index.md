Our group is called 666 group, which is composed by chance. It is very random! 
Let's introduce the six of us. 
Focus, the group's face value; Hu Zhiwei, the son of the focus; Song Shi Ning, cold and interesting dual character; Liu Feixue, will not write the self-introduction of poor patients; Li Haiyan, indifferent Leo; Jiang Mingzi, did not give me a self-introduction
